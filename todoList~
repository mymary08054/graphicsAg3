^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The drawShape runs the correct number of times
the coordinates are correct
the shapes after the 1st two do not appear
running the coordinates again within the same method does make another poly appear
>>something is happening after the 2nd poly that stops the rest from appearing

(2) Implement the RayTriangle::drawOpenGL (in Ray/rayTriangle.todo.cpp) method to draw a triangle with per-vertex normals. For now, ignore the texture coordinates and the input materialIndex parameter, and have the method return -1.

(3) Implement triangle texture mapping. To do this you will have to:
Modify the implementation of RayTriangle::drawOpenGL (in Ray/rayTriangle.todo.cpp) to specify the texture coordinates prior to specifying the vertex positions.
Modify the implementation of RayMaterial::drawOpenGL (in Ray/RayScene.todo.cpp) method to enable and bind the texture if it is present.
Modify the implementation of RayTexture::setUpOpenGL (in Ray/RayScene.todo.cpp) method to generate the texture handle.

(1) Implement the RayBox::drawOpenGL (in Ray/rayBox.todo.cpp) method to draw a box.
(1) Implement the RayCylinder::drawOpenGL (in Ray/rayCylinder.todo.cpp) method to draw a cylinder with bottom and top caps at the appropriate tesselation. (You may want to consider using the gluCylinder and gluDisk functions from the GLU library to assist you with this.)
(1) Implement the RayCone::drawOpenGL (in Ray/rayCone.todo.cpp) method to draw a cone capped off at the bottom at the appropriate tesselation. (You may want to consider using the gluCylinder and gluDisk functions from the GLU library to assist you with this.)

(2) Implement full scene anti-aliasing using the accumulation buffer. Hint: See the OpenGL Programming Guide for information about jittering.

Generate a .ray file describing a room scene with:
    (1) Four walls, a floor and ceiling.
    (3) A table, several chairs, etc. You may choose more interesting furnishings.
    (1) At least one transparent surface, perhaps the table top.
    (1) At least three texture mapped surfaces, each with a different texture.
    (1) At least three point or spot light sources.
    (2) A Luxo Jr. style lamp with keyboard and/or mouse controls for manipulating the joints of the lamp interactively while the spot light representing the bulb moves accordingly. Hint: see the robotic arm example in the OpenGL Programming Guide.
    (2) A mirror. Hint: Reflect the world about the mirror and render it again through a stencil buffer.
    (2) Shadows on at least one surface (such as the floor or table). Hint: See the OpenGL Programming Guide for the transformation which renders objects onto a plane.
    (2) An object that responds to user mouse clicks (such as a light switch which turns on/off a light when clicked on by the user).

(1) In general, making a call to OpenGL's glMaterial* commands can be somewhat expensive. Rather than calling these functions before you draw every RayShape, modify the RayShape::drawOpenGL of the different subclasses so that:
You first test if the if the index of the material associated to the primitive is the same as the input materialIndex paramter and only call the RayMaterial::drawOpenGL method if they differ.
Return the index of the last material used.
OpenGL Shading Language (See the specification for more details.)
    (2) Write vertex and fragment shaders that implement the traditional fixed pipeline with Gouraud Shading.
    (2) Write vertex and fragment shaders that implement the traditional fixed pipeline with Phong Shading.
    (2) Adapt your Phong shader to support bump mapping.
(2) Modify the OpenGL renderer to allow the user to ray-trace the scene from the same perspective as the RayCamera.

The assignment will be graded out of 30 points. In addition to implementing these features, there are several other ways to get more points:
(1) Submitting one or more images for the art contest.
(1) Submitting one or more .ray files for the art contest.
(1) Submitting one or more shader files for the art contest. You may consult online resources (make sure to do reference) but the shaders must be your own creation.


===============================

Lights

Bounding Box
-find intersection with bounding box
    intersect with only faces facing you?
    Must construct plames from 2 given points
    Find algorithm online?

-Find out what the points that are being used are for sure...

-add in bBox for triangle

Trying to implement raybox (as if it's a bbox! Will do correct implementation later)
---------------------------
Assignment2 --in Mybox.ray --out testbox.bmp --width 500 --height 500 --rLimit 5 --cLimit 0.0001

[bbox implementatiom. treat the given pts as bbox pts
Find ray projection range
****
note that we must reset return_dist to -1 after EACH face
]

[ for actual raybox
Is this true?
The box extends from x=cx-lx/2 to x=cx+lx/2, y=cy-ly/2 to y=cy+ly/2, and z=cz-lz/2 to z=cz+lz/2.

since length = lx,ly,lz
maybe we need to calc the lengths for ourselves....great :(
